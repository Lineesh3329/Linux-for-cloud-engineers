## Process Management

In Linux, a process is a running program.

Process management allows us to monitor, control, and manage running applications in the system.

It is important for troubleshooting high CPU usage, memory issues, and unresponsive services in production servers.

        nohup - Runs a command or script in the background that doesn't terminate even after logout.
                Used for python jobs, deployments, servers, long running scripts, cron jobs.
                Basically inorder to run code in background nohup is used.
