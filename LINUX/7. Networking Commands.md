## Networking Commands

Networking commands in Linux are used to check connectivity, network configuration, and troubleshoot communication issues.

These commands help identify problems like server not reachable, DNS issues, or port not responding.

They are very important in cloud and production environments.

### Basic Networking Commands
    hostname                   - Show system hostname
    ping hostname              - Check connectivity
    ip addr                    - Show IP address
    ifconfig                   - Show network configuration
    netstat -tuln              - Show listening ports
    ss -tuln                   - Show active connections
    traceroute hostname        - Trace network path
    nslookup domain            - Check DNS resolution
    curl "url"                 - Fetch data from URL
    wget "url"                 - Download file

### Usage
    If website is not loading:
        1. ping server
        2. Check IP using ip addr
        3. Check port using netstat or ss
        4. Verify DNS using nslookup
        
Networking commands help diagnose connectivity and communication issues in Linux systems.
Understanding these tools is essential for managing cloud servers and troubleshooting real-world problems.

SSH- Secure Shell
-------------------
SSH is a secure protocol used to connect to a remote server over a network. It allows users to log in to another system and execute commands securely. SSH uses encryption to protect data, so nobody read our passwords or datum during communication over network.

### Tools Used in SSH Communication
- SSH Client             → Used to connect to remote server
- SSH Server (sshd)      → Runs on remote machine
- Port 22                → Default SSH communication port
- Public & Private Keys  → Used for secure authentication
