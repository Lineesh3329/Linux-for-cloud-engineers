## File Permissions & Ownership

In Linux, every file and directory has access control rules called permissions. Permissions decide who can read, write, or execute a file. This security mechanism protects system files and application data in servers and cloud environments. Understanding file permissions is very important for managing users and troubleshooting access issues.

#### There are three types of users:

    User (Owner)  -   The user who owns the file
    Group         -   Members of the file's group
    Others        -   Every else excluding the owner & group
    Root user is the super user.
    
#### There are three types of permissions:
    | PERMISSION | SYMBOL |  VALUE  |
    ---------------------------------
    | Read       |    r   |     4    |
    | Write      |    w   |     2    |
    | Execute    |    x   |     1    |
    |--------------------------------| 
    |      +     | Give Persmission  |
    |      -     | Remove Persmission|

Example:
-rwxr-xr--     

#### This means:
    | Owner  → rwx (read, write, execute) |  754 - sum of values, where  |
    | Group  → r-x (read, execute)        |  1st Digit - User            |                               |
    | Others → r-- (read only)            |  2nd Digit - Group           |
    |                                     |  3rd Digit - Others          |


### chmod (Change Permissions)

        chmod 755 file.txt    
        chmod +x script.sh
        chmod -r file.txt


### chown (Change Owner)

        chown user file.txt
        chown user:group file.txt


### chgrp (Change Group)

        chgrp group file.txt


### Numeric Permission Meaning

        7 → rwx (4+2+1)
        6 → rw- (4+2)
        5 → r-x (4+1)
        4 → r--


File permissions are an important part of Linux security.
They help control access to files and protect system data.
These permissions and ownership is essential for managing servers and troubleshooting access issues in real-world environments.
