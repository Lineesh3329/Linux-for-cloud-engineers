## File Permissions & Ownership

Linux controls access to files using permissions.

There are three types of users:
- User (Owner)
- Group
- Others

There are three types of permissions:
- r → Read
- w → Write
- x → Execute

Example:
-rwxr-xr--

This means:
Owner  → rwx (read, write, execute)
Group  → r-x (read, execute)
Others → r-- (read only)


### chmod (Change Permissions)

chmod 755 file.txt
chmod +x script.sh
chmod -r file.txt


### chown (Change Owner)

chown user file.txt
chown user:group file.txt


### chgrp (Change Group)

chgrp group file.txt


### Numeric Permission Meaning

7 → rwx (4+2+1)
6 → rw- (4+2)
5 → r-x (4+1)
4 → r--
