Basic Linux commands are essential for working in server and cloud environments. They help in navigating directories, managing files, viewing logs, and searching for important data inside the system. Strong command-line knowledge improves troubleshooting skills and makes server management easier.

1). Navigation Commands
-------------------
Navigation commands are used to move between directories in Linux. Used for moving server directories and access application files.
            
            pwd      - Shows current working directory
            ls       - Lists files and folders
            ls -l    - Detailed list view
            ls -a    - Shows hidden files
            ls *.txt - Opens file starting with ".txt"
            ls hello* - Opens file starting with "hello"
            ls -lstr - Shows files by size
            cd       - Change directory
            cd ..    - Go one level up
            cd /     - Go to root
            cd ~     - Go to home directory
            tree     - Show folder structure

2). File Operations
--------------------
File operation commands are used to create, delete, copy, and move files. Used to manage application files, logs, and backups in production servers.
           
              touch file.txt    - Create new file
              mkdir folder_name - Create new directory
              mkdir -p          - Creates multiple directories
              cp file1 file2 - copy → file or folder
              cp                - Copy file
              mv                - Move or rename file
              rm file.txt       - Delete file
              rm folder_name    - Delete folder
              rm *.txt          - removes txt.files        

3). Viewing Files
-----------------
This helps to read file contents without opening an editor. Allows us to check application logs and debug issues.

              cat file.txt                  - Display file content
              cat file1.txt >> file2.txt    - Copies contents from one to another
              less file.txt                 - View large file page by page
              head file.txt                 - Show first 10 lines
              tail file.txt                 - Show last 10 lines
              tail -f file.txt              - Monitor live logs
              nl file.txt                   - Show line numbers
              awk                           - print specific cloumns
              history                       - shows previous commands

4). Searching Files
-------------------
These below commands are helps to find files or search content inside files. Helps to locate configuration files and search error messages in logs.

              find / file.txt      - → Find file
              locate filename      - Quickly find file
              which command        - Show command location
              grep "word" file.txt - Search word inside file

5). Other Commands
------------------
#### Echo
This commands used to print values.

            echo "Linux"                - Prints "Linux"
            echo "Linux" >> myfile.txt  - Append "Linux" in myfile.txt

#### Touch
This command creates empty file.

            touch hello.txt - Creates empty file

#### Alias
This helps to make our own command (shortcut) for a long command. Alias disappears once if we close the terminal. To make it permanent add it to ~/.bashrc

            Long command   --->   cd/home/linux/abc/text/demo
            
            Alias          --->   alias My= "cd/home/linux/abc/text/demo"

            Now type,      --->  My - (shows the directory (goto)).


Basic commands are fundamental for daily operations in Linux systems.

They are widely used in server administration and cloud environments also are essential for operating and managing Linux systems effectively.
