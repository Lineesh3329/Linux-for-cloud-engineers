Introduction to Linux
---------------------
Linux is an open-source operating system widely used in servers and cloud environments.
It is known for its stability, security, and strong command-line capabilities.
Most modern cloud platforms like AWS run on Linux-based servers, which makes Linux an essential skill for Cloud and DevOps engineers.
Understanding Linux helps in managing servers, troubleshooting issues, monitoring processes, and handling real-world production systems.

### Linux vs Unix
-------------


|  Feature          |         Linux                |     Unix                        |
|-------------------|------------------------------|---------------------------------|
|  Origin           |      Linux Torvalds (1991)   |   AT&T Bell Labs(1970s)         |
|  License          |      Open Source (GNU GPL)   |   Closed Source                 |
|  Cost             |      Free                    |   Commercial                    |
|  Architecture     |      Runs on x86, ARM etc..  |   Usually on RISC architectures |
|  Development      |      Communnity Driven       |   Vendor Driven                 |
|  Examples         |      Ubuntu, Fedora, CentOs  |   Solaris, AIX, HP-UX           |


        
### Popular Linux Distributions (Distros)
-------------------------------------
    Ubuntu                 - User-friendly, perfect for beginners
    Debain                 - Stable, great for servers
    Fedora                 - Cutting-edge by Redhat
    CentOS/Rocky/AlmaLinux - Enterprise-level
    Arch Linux             - Minimalist, highly customizable
    Kali Linux             - Cybersecurity testing

### Why do we need Linux
----------------------
    Free & Open Source - No license fees
    Security           - Strong permissions, less vulnerable
    Stable             - Used for long-running servers
    Customizable       - Tailor everything to your needs
    Efficient          - Works well on old hardware too
    Powerful CLI       - Efficient Inteface

### Is Linux Really an OS
---------------------
Linux itself = Kernel only

A full OS    = Linux Kernel + GNU Utilities + Bash + Package Manager

Linux Distros are complete operations systems built around the Linux kernel

### Kernel
------
The core engine of the OS

Manages: CPU Schedulinng, Memory allocation, I/O operations, Device Management

Linux uses a *Monolithic Kernel*.
